		  <h3>My Greatest Growth</h3>
			<br />
          <p>My greatest growth during my time at the Dayton Regional STEM School is coding. Throughout the years, I have learned multiple coding languages and different tags within those languages. In my sixth grade year I knew next to nothing about coding, and I was only able to use pre-coded apps like Ozobots. In seventh grade I started to learn more about coding and was able to add in borders, background images, and tab icons. In eighth grade I learned how to add tables and videos. In tenth grade I taught myself how to add in a slideshow. In eleventh grade, I redid my page and learned JavaScript to make my portfolio run more smoothly. This year I learned more JavaScript to be able to fix any bugs within my code. This experience will help me in university and beyond due to the amount of coding knowledge needed for cognitive science.</p>

              This was my second year of learning code, but I learned a lot. Sadly my first page from sixth grade was corrupted and lost, but in seventh gradae I was able to add borders, multiple pages, CSS, and a background image. I was very excited to implement these recently learned skills, and I was very proud of it at the time. Looking back, I wish I picked better colors or a more cohesive color scheme due to it looking all over the place. However, I was very into the Northern Lights at the time so the blue and purple made sense.

              In eighth grade, I learned how to add videos and a dropdown. I struggled with this dropdown since it was sized slightly different than the rest of the links, and I was never able to truly fix it. My code was very messy during this time, so it was harder to find coding errors.

              In high school we stopped having a dedicated coding class. Due to this, we had to self-teach ourselves many things. I was not a huge fan of my page at the time, so I was starting to recode my website but due to the limited time I gave up on redoing the page and choose to make sure that everything new I added looked nice. So, I made sure that I was happy with my slide show. I was, in fact I used it the next year when I scrapped my old code and started over.

              In eleventh grade, I didn't do what I had done previously with copy and pasting my old portfolio to this year and changing the home page and adding another page for the next year. I made an entirely new page, and I was very happy with it. It looked much more professional than previous years and I found out about the column element, making it very simple and easy for me to divide my page into columns. I used the column tag on multiple places on my portfolio. I was also able to finally have a dropdown that was the same size as the other links in my header. It was professional but still allowed me some creative freedom.

              This year, twelfth grade, I did not learn much HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. However, I was a faculty assistant for Ms. Kovar who is a middle school coding teacher. I have helped the students with their code in Python, HTML, and CSS. I am excited to continue helping the students learn and understand code. It reminds me of the quote by Frank Oppenheimer, "The best way to learn is to teach."
