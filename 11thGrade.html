          <h2>11th Grade</h2>
          <p>My greatest growth for my 11th grade year was my self confidence, and I will show this growth through fashion. At the beginning of the year, I did not have the same self-confidence I have today. Throughout the year, I have slowly improved ways to manage anxiety and how I deal with situations. My anxiety and self-confidence are very associated with each other. Being diagnosed for Social Anxiety Disorder makes my self confidence hard to grow, but I am proud of how far I have come this year.</p>

              This image is from the beginning of the year, the day before my birthday. I had been too anxious to push for a birthday party, even though I wanted to celebrate my 16th birthday with my friends. I figured my 16th birthday would be a big deal, but when two people couldn't make it, I cancelled the entire party, since I did not want to face more rejections.

			  I had also recently left a long-term toxic relationship, so I was navigating high school for the first time without a romantic relationship to also navigate. I was learning how the relationship had been negatively impacting my mental health, and growing as a person without her. I was still unlearning unhealthy behaviors she had taught me.
			</p>
			<p>
			  I was starting to experiment with my fashion style, with my limited amount of freedom of choice. My mother was pretty strict on clothing I was allowed to have, only allowing a low neckline once for a school dance. I found out quickly that I liked the look of jackets over other shirts.

			  This image is from when I put together my Homecoming outfit. I combined a dress from a dance cancelled from COVID, and an altered blazer. I was gaining my self confidence, experimenting with combining masculine and feminine clothing styles, resulting in a gender neutral I wanted to achieve at the time. I still presented very feminine at the time, wanting to stay within my comfort zone.
			</p>
			<p>
			  I had not felt experimenting with jewelry, worried about having to spend a lot of money on quality jewelry such as necklaces, bracelets, and rings. My sensitive skin means that I have to double check my jewelry will not react to my skin, often making it difficult to find cheaper jewelry that I liked or could even wear. I had just started working at this time, and very stingy about spending money. I was worried that I would regret any spent money since it was not going into my savings. It was difficult to build my self-confidence when I was afraid to spend any money, and not putting myself first over anything else.

			  This image is my prom outfit. The theme was Northern Lights, so I was glad that I had a dress with glow-in-the-dark constellations. However, I wanted to make a more extravagant outfit to go to prom. So, the logical explanation was to make a light-up skirt. It took a lot of effort, but I was so happy about the result, with a bunch of people complimenting my skirt at prom! It felt super nice to be able to enjoy myself even without my closer friends, some of them not wanting to go and others having dates. So enjoying myself while going by myself proves that I have grown in my self confidence.
			</p>
			<p>
			  I was not wearing a ton of jewelry, since I already had a lot going on with black light activated glitter and eyeshadow, the glow-in-the-dark top and light-up skirt. Sadly, they didn't have any black lights to activate the glitter, but I still enjoyed myself. I had a lot of fun, hopping around different groups, talking to a bunch of people I sometimes don't get to interact with at school but still love talking to. I think this is also proof since I was confident to talk to many different people.
