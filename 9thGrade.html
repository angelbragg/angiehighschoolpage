		<h1> My 9th Grade Self </h1>
		<p>
			My name is Angie. Some things I really like are doodling, singing, and writing. I really want to become a Pediatrician when I grow up, because I was interested in health from a young age, and I want to work with kids when I grow up. On the first day of my freshman year, I was kind of scared by my teachers, but I’ve quickly learned that most of them are very friendly. I think I am going to do really well this school year, I want to get above a 3.5 GPA overall, and I think I can achieve that.

		<h1> My Greatest Growth </h1>
		<p>
			I grew the most in note taking and study techniques because I developed a note style that worked for me and study guide layouts. I was good at knowing when to define words that I would not remember, and I was good at knowing when a change would work for me or not. This did mean that when I had to take notes in a different style, I would fail at remembering the information, since it did not work as well as my note-taking. I struggled with remembering dates, and I often could not find minor details when I needed to because I did not emphasize the headings. Even though I had information in intricate detail, I did not know where any of it was since I did not have anything emphasized or organized in anyway. I changed some of the sizing of the writing so I emphasized the headings, dates, and names so when I looked at my notes I could see and remember the important details first and then look at the smaller details. I summarized information so I would not take up multiple pages for just a single day’s worth of notes, but my notes were still comprehensible. If I did not remember what a word meant while reviewing my notes, I could still have room to define the word nearby the word. This helped me a lot because now I can easily look at my notes and know where everything is. It has greatly increased my quiz grades in History, and it has helped my practical grades in Language Arts.
