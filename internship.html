              The internship program at the Dayton Regional STEM School is an opportunity for students to receive a real world experience during their high school career. Students get the opportunity to choose which organization they apply to. During the internship, the student must complete 80 hours of interning with the organization. The main objectives are to give students valuable workplace experiences, future opportunities, and practice networking. For my internship, I am interning with Dr. Adriane Griffen at the American Academy of Orthotists and Prothetists. My internship was over the summer of 2022, and I had a lovely time with my mentor and the team I worked with.

			  This was the first day of my intership. I joined a Zoom meeting so I could meet all of the people within the branch. After the Zoom meeting, I started working on a Year-At-A-Glance for the copmany, adding in holidays and researching information about how to celebrate for  the future Monthly Newsletters.

			  This was the third day of my intership. I spent most of the day finding resources to educate chapters on 501c3 finances and how to file their taxes. I found multiple resources and sent them to my supervisor. Then I utilized social media and found multiple creators in the same field as examples for representation.

We also discussed tasks everyone had to complete that day. After the meeting, I worked on organizing the monthly financial reports into a yearly report with averages of spending for months. I  also included if there was overspending in a month.

          <h2>Internship Reflection</h2>
          <p>The internship experience was very impactful to me. I was able to learn how to work together with fellow workers in a workplace setting. I gained skills in customer service and interaction. I learned from this experience that a hands-on workplace environment is more beneficial to me. I am grateful for this experience because it helped me with work experience and virtual work environment. </p>
		  <br />
		  <p>Going into this internship, I didn't know anyone on the team. I was included in multiple meetings and took notes on the topics discussed in the meetings. The others in the meetings were very kind and their best to include me in the conversations however I didn't have the same level of knowledge as them. Many of them have been studying for years in public health and I am a high schooler. Regardless, I was proud of how easily I kept up with conversation, looking up key terms I didn't understand later or asking for clarification so I could understand and follow the conversation. I am proud of how I overcame the struggle with working within a team whom I had no previous connection to. Another struggle was that because I knew no one it was hard at the beginning to cooperate with them. I had never previously had to work with strangers, since I had always known my classmates when paired up for projects. However, I overcame this struggle by involving myself in conversation in meetings and email conversations to provide input. Through this, I was able to judge how professional I should be and the communication levels within the group. </p>
		  <br />
		  <p>I learned how to talk to customers and help them through tasks and get necessary information for their accounts. One of the projects I was on was to help members input information into their system. This was an interesting project, because I had to go through all of the contact information for everyone missing sections of their profile. I also had to go through their workplaces and choose one to use for all of those employees. A problem I ran into during this was the use of abbreviations by many students in different universities. One main issue I ran into was the use of "MSU", which I found could have meant Mississippi State University, Missouri State University, Massachusetts State University, Michigan State University, and more. There are eight different states in the United States that start with "M" and all of them have state universities. I was able to go through emails since some of them put their school emails so I could narrow down based off their school emails, yet many students had to clarify where they attended school due to lack of clarity. </p>
		  <br />
		  <p>A technology I learned how to use during this internship was VOIP. It is a way to call people over the internet, which I had never heard of outside of Zoom, Skype, and other similar applications. However, VOIP is different due to you use an actual phone number to call another phone number, as a replacement of a phone. This technology was incredibly useful since I could call members without having to use my own number. It was really cool to use this application and be able to apply this knowledge in the future.</p>
		  <br />
		  <p>This internship it made me realize I would prefer to work in a hands-on environment rather than in a customer-service based job. I enjoyed working on spreadsheets and in the lab more than interacting with customers. Customer service isn't an opposed position to me but not preferred. The ability to work on my own or with my coworkers was simpler and more efficient. This helped me narrow down what I wanted to study in university, since knowing that my preference is not a general public job. I am going to enter university as undecided so knowing the type of job and my interests will help me sort out fields of study that would not be preferable in the future.</p>
		  <br />
		  <p>In conclusion, this internship challenged me and pushed me to my best. This internship was pivotal in helping me realize that I am incredibly productive in a virtual work environment and it provides less stress for me than an in-person customer service job. Another thing I learned is that I am good at customer service, however I do not enjoy it. Furthermore, I would prefer a job not customer-focused but with the knowledge I am effective at customer communication I can implement this into later job opportunities. </p>

          <h2>Career Exploration Report</h2>
          <p>This report documents the exploration of two careers and four potential internships related to those careers. Extensive research was conducted about the two chosen careers, psychiatry and astronomy. Many government and health research websites were used, such as the Occupational Outlook Handbook and the American Psychiatry Association webpage. All this research resulted in the location of four internships. The preferred internship is the Boonshoft Museum’s planetarium due to location and specific skills and responsibilities. Next steps include contacting the companies in charge of the possible internships and setting up timeframes in which to complete the internship.</p>
